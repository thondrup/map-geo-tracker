# Map

## Why create it?
I want all the people in a group to see each others geo positions on a map.

## Technical
The application is hosted as static content. To run it locally, use for instance
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll").

### Install
Install Jekyll:
```
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc nodejs
sudo gem install jekyll --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

### Run
Fire up the website by starting jekyll
```
jekyll serve
```
